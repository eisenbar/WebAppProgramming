    <p id="paragraph"> <b>Episode IV A NEW HOPE:</b>
        It is a period of civil war.
        Rebel spaceships, striking
        from a hidden base, have won
        their first victory against
        the evil Galactic Empire.

        During the battle, Rebel
        spies managed to steal secret
        plans to the Empire's
        ultimate weapon, the DEATH
        STAR, an armored space
        station with enough power to
        destroy an entire planet.

        Pursued by the Empire's
        sinister agents, Princess
        Leia races home aboard her
        starship, custodian of the
        stolen plans that can save
        her people and restore
        freedom to the galaxy.....
    </p>
    <p id="paragraph"> <b>Episode V THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK:</b>
        It is a dark time for the Rebellion. Although the Death Star has been destroyed, Imperial troops have driven the
        Rebel forces from their hidden base and pursued them across the galaxy.
        Evading the dreaded Imperial Starfleet, a group of freedom fighters led by Luke Skywalker has established a new
        secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth.

        The evil lord Darth Vader, obsessed with finding young Skywalker, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into
        the far reaches of spaceâ€¦.
